# ðŸš€ Application Status

## âœ… What's Working

- **SvelteKit server running** at `http://localhost:5173/`
- **Convex deployment active** at `formal-penguin-443.convex.cloud`
- **All configuration files** created and fixed
- **Components built** with responsive design

## ðŸ”§ Current Issue

The server is running but there are some missing SvelteKit internal files. This is common with manual setup.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Access the App (Recommended)
Try opening `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser. The app might work despite the console errors.

### Option 2: Restart the Server
1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: `npm run dev` again
3. The sync should happen automatically

### Option 3: Manual Sync
If you can run commands, try:
```bash
npx svelte-kit sync
```
