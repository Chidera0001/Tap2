# 🔧 Cache Issue - Need to Restart Dev Server

## 🚨 **Problem**

The error is showing an old cached version of the file with SVG data URLs, but the current file has been fixed with CSS gradients.

## ✅ **Solution**

**You need to restart the dev server to clear the cache:**

1. **Stop the current dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Clear any cache** (optional):
   ```bash
   cd tap2-loyalty-dashboard
   rm -rf .svelte-kit
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```
3. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 **What Should Happen**

After restarting:
- ✅ No more SVG data URL errors
- ✅ Beautiful CSS gradient patterns
- ✅ All styling working perfectly
- ✅ Professional visual design

## 📝 **Current File Status**

The StatCard.svelte file is now correct with:
- CSS `radial-gradient` patterns instead of SVG data URLs
- All three pattern locations fixed
- No syntax errors

**The cache just needs to be cleared by restarting the dev server! 🚀**
